what is difference between entailnment and pressupositions?; Pressupositions survive negation whilst entailnments do not i.e., Czechia has a king called Jakub entails that there is a man called Jakub, whilst Czechia does not have a king called Jakub does not entail that Czechia has a king. On the other hand Jakub does not remember signing the contract and Jakub does remember signing the contract has a pressuposition relationship as from both we can concluded that Jakub did sign the contract
