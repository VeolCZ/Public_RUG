## A game containing all terms from the book

To run the game use the *game.py* file which will automatically test you on the knowladge of the unique terms. Whils answering it will keep track on how well you do. Adjusting the frequency of certain terms in the test dataset. You can also view how well you did on each term using the *show_performance.py* script.

*csv_maker.py* generates the *output.csv* which contains the term-definition pairs. In case of issue just raise a PR :)

Requirements:
- pandas
- matplotlib
